# YAP-Wrapper
Python interface to Bar-Ilan University ONLP lab (https://nlp.biu.ac.il/~rtsarfaty/onlp) YAP (Yet another parser) https://github.com/OnlpLab/yap.

Yap is a free tool, If you make use of YAP for research, we would appreciate the following citation: 
https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/Q/Q19/Q19-1003.bib

Alternatively you may use the SaaS server (free use), https://www.langndata.com/heb_parser/overview that case you need only one line of code: https://www.langndata.com/api/heb_parser?token=[YOUR TOKEN HERE]&data="גנן גידל דגן בגן"

How to use:
========
1. Install YAP (instruction are on YAP page.... https://github.com/OnlpLab/yap)
2. After installing YAP, run it as HTTP server, by simply run "./yap api" from command line. Now Yap is running as HTTP serve on port 8000.
3. Run the Python code in yap_api.py file ==> main method.
The python code is calling YAP server via HTTP request...

  	3.1 If YAP is not installed locally, set the IP address on yap_api.py main method.
4. The code return 6 elements:
* tokenized_text- string. The text tokenized.
* segmented_text - string. The text segmented.
* lemmas - string. The lemmas of the text.
* dep_tree - DataFrame. Dependency tree.
* md_lattice - DataFrame. Morphological analysis, as decided by YAP.
* ma_lattice - DataFrame. Morphological analysis inlcuding all possible lattices.

For example, if original text is: "בתוך עיניה הכחולות"
Then output is:
* tokenized_text- "בתוך עיניה הכחולות" 
* segmented_text - "בתוך עיניה ה כחולות"
* lemmas - "בתוך עין ה כחול"
* dep_tree -

In this version, the returned language schema follows the UD guidelines, rather than the original YAP SPMRL. 
The conversion follows the SPMRL guidelines as illustrated in ["A Unified Morpho-Syntactic Scheme of Stanford Dependencies"](https://aclanthology.org/P13-2103.pdf)
